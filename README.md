# Decentralized Lucid Dream Research Platform (DLDR)

A blockchain-based platform for coordinating large-scale lucid dreaming research while preserving participant privacy and ensuring scientific rigor.

## Overview

The Decentralized Lucid Dream Research Platform (DLDR) enables researchers and participants to collaborate on structured lucid dreaming experiments. The system provides secure data collection, validated reporting mechanisms, and incentive structures while maintaining strict privacy standards.

## Key Features

### Secure Dream Reporting
- End-to-end encrypted dream journals
- Biometric data integration
- Standardized reporting templates
- Time-stamped dream logs
- Voice recording support
- Multi-language capabilities

### Experiment Protocol Management
- Structured experiment design tools
- Participant randomization
- Control group management
- Protocol compliance tracking
- Automated milestone verification
- Sleep schedule coordination

### Privacy-Preserving Data Collection
- Zero-knowledge proofs for data validation
- Homomorphic encryption for aggregate analysis
- Selective disclosure controls
- Data anonymization protocols
- Secure multi-party computation
- Federated learning support

### Scientific Validation System
- Peer review workflow
- Expert verification protocol
- Cross-reference checking
- Pattern analysis tools
- Statistical validation
- Anomaly detection

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
```solidity
// Core contracts:
DreamRegistry.sol         // Manages dream reports
ExperimentFactory.sol     // Creates experiment instances
ParticipantToken.sol      // Handles participant incentives
ValidationOracle.sol      // Verifies achievement claims
```

### Data Layer
